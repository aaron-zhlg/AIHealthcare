# Public fMRI and Neuroimaging Datasets

## 1. Overview

fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a **neuroimaging modality**, not a dataset by itself. It measures changes in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals over time and is commonly represented as a 4D volume:

```text
X × Y × Z × T
```

where `X, Y, Z` represent spatial dimensions and `T` represents time.

Public datasets and repositories such as HCP, ABIDE, ADNI, OpenNeuro, and UK Biobank provide fMRI and/or other neuroimaging data for neuroscience and medical AI research.

A common fMRI-to-AI pipeline is:

```text

Preprocessing
  ↓
Brain parcellation / ROI extraction
  ↓
Regional time series
  ↓
Functional connectivity
  ↓
Brain graph
  ↓
GNN / Transformer / ML
  ↓
Disease or cognitive prediction
```

## 2. HCP — Human Connectome Project

**Type:** Large neuroimaging research project / dataset  
**Primary focus:** Human brain connectivity and cognitive neuroscience  
**fMRI:** Yes

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is one of the most important resources for studying human brain connectivity. HCP provides structural MRI, resting-state fMRI, task fMRI, diffusion MRI, and behavioral/cognitive measurements.

### Why it is useful

HCP is particularly well suited for:

- Functional connectivity
- Brain network analysis
- Connectomics
- Brain graph learning
- Cognitive prediction
- Representation learning

A typical graph formulation is:

```text
Brain regions → graph nodes
Functional connectivity → graph edges
Subject-level cognition → prediction target
```

### Data access

HCP data are openly available to the scientific community, but access requires registration and agreement to the HCP Data Use Agreement. After approval, users can download the data.

**Official resource:** https://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/data/

### AI research value

**Excellent for:** GNNs, graph transformers, connectome modeling, functional connectivity, and brain-behavior prediction.

       ↓
Functional connectivity
       ↓
Subject-specific brain graph
       ↓
ASD vs. healthy control
```

### Why it is useful

ABIDE is particularly useful for:

- ASD classification
- Functional connectivity analysis

## 9. Key Terminology

It is important not to treat these terms as equivalent:

```text
fMRI
│
└── Neuroimaging modality / data type
       │
       ├── HCP
       ├── ABIDE
       └── ADNI
             └── Specific research datasets/projects

OpenNeuro
└── Repository containing many neuroimaging datasets

UK Biobank
└── Large population cohort containing imaging + genetics + health data
```

In short:

> **fMRI is a data modality. HCP, ABIDE, and ADNI are research datasets/projects. OpenNeuro is a public neuroimaging repository. UK Biobank is a large population cohort with extensive imaging and health data.**

For an initial **AI + neuroscience** project, OpenNeuro is the easiest place to start, ABIDE is a strong benchmark for disease classification, HCP is excellent for connectomics, and ADNI/UK Biobank are particularly valuable for multimodal medical AI.
